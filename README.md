 Project Name: Sephora Skincare Products \ Moisturizers
  Date: 28/02/2023
The goal of this project is to identify the best moisturizers among Sephora's skincare products. To achieve this, the first step is to clean the dataset by removing duplicates and null values, and ensuring consistency in date and currency formats, as well as measurement units (i.e., all in ounces).
During the cleaning process, it was noted that 43 products did not have a size listed as "None." To address this issue, the product size was obtained from the Sephora website. Out-of-stock items were removed from the dataset, as the focus is on available products only. For the remaining products, the missing size information was added to the dataset.
Now that the data is cleaned, the analysis can begin. The following points will be explored: 
• Identifying patterns and relationships between product size, price, and brand name 
• Determining which category of moisturizer (eye cream, face serum, or face moisturizer) has the highest price range.
This project aims to provide insights that can assist customers in making informed decisions when choosing moisturizers from Sephora's skincare product line.
